  <h2>Trigonometry + quadratic equation</h2>
  <h3>Descriptions</h3>
  <p>Algebra 2 is a trickier version of Algebra 1, in this class, you will have to grasp and memorize many different concepts but the 2 that will help you the most the Trigonometry and solving quadratic equation </p>
  <h3>Trigonometry</h3>
  <p>trigonometry have 6 different formula: sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot.</p>
  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p><br><b>Sin:</b> Sin stand for sine, which is saying that a sine of a triangle is equal to the opposite side over the hypotenus, you will need to you know to calculate the other formula and to calculate triangles problem</br></p>
  <p><br><b>Cos:</b> this stands for cosine, and it is equal to the adjacent over hypotenuse of a triangle. </br></p>
  <p><br><b>tan:</b> this stands for tangent, it is equal to the opposite over adjacent and another way you can find tangent is take sin and divide it by cos</br></p>
  <p><br><b>Csc, Sec, and Cot:</b> these are the opposite of Sin, Cosine, and Tangent. Csc is the opposite of cosine, which is hypotenuse over opposite. Sec is the oppo of cosine which is hypotenuse over adjacent. And cot is the opposite of tangent which is Adjacent over opposite </br></p>
  <h3>Quadratic equation</h3>
  <br><p>this was mentioned in Algebra one,this is a reminder for all the student to remember the equation x = (+2¬±‚àö4-4(1)(1))/2 and solve the equation</p></br>
  <h3>This will help you get through most of Algebra 2 with an A, These concept will help you tremendously if you memorize themüëç</h3>
