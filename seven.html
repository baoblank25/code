  <h2>Proving Triangles</h2>
  <h3>Descriptions</h3>
  <p>This is a cheat sheet for geometry and it will have every proving property that you need to pass the class, the class will be much easier if you remember this cheat sheet</p>
  <h3>Proves Property</h3>
  <p>Proves property contains 4 property: SSS, SAS, ASA, AAA</p>
  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p><br><b>SSS:</b> This is when 2 triangle have 3 equal side, this proves that the triangle is equal</br></p>
  <p><br><b>SAS:</b> This is when 2 triangles have 2 equal side and 1 equal angle, this also makes a triangle, and if you are proving this property is the most common</br></p>
  <p><br><b>ASA:</b> This is when 2 triangles have 2 equal angle and 1 equal side, this one can be tricky because sometimes people forget this property, and they ended up having to do much more complicated work, make sure to keep this one in mind</br></p>
  <p><br><b>AAS:</b> this is similar to the one above because when the side is not placed in the middle of the angle, this one is least use because you can change this to ASA by subtracting the 2 given angle by 180, but it is useful to know just in case people forget ASA</br></p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <br><p>Just remember these properties of triangle proves and you are on your way to getting an A in Geometry class!</p></br>
