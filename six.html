  <h2>Quadratic equation</h2>
  <h3>Descriptions</h3>
  <p>Any equation containing one term in which the unknown is squared and no term in which it is raised to a higher power, you should pass Algebra 1 if you know how to solve a quadratic equation</p>
  <h3>What it is used for?</h3>
  <p>Quadratic equation is used for graphing a parabola, this concept is one of the most important in Algebra 1</p>
  <h3>Quadratic formula</h3>
  <p>this is used for solving a quadratic equation and it looks like this(x = (âˆ’bÂ±âˆšb^2âˆ’4ac)/2a</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <h4>Problem:x^2-2x+1</h4>
  <p>
    <br>Step 1: identify a, b , and c</br>
  <br>a is the coefficient of the x^2, b is the coefficient of x and c is the number without any x</br>
  <br>Step 2: plug into the equation</br>
    <br>x = (+2Â±âˆš4-4(1)(1))/2</br>
    <br>if you plug that into your calculator you should get x = 1</br>
